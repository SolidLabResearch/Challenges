# How to create challenges from a use case

1. Select your use case.
For example, a use case can be an online shop based on Solid.
2. Create scenarios from your use case.
A scenario describes a specific use of the system of the use case.
For example, a scenario can be a user logging into our online shop and making an order
by using information stored in the user's pod.
3. For every scenario do the following.
   1. Create an issue in this repo with the [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/scenario.md) called "scenario".
   2. Create challenges from the scenario.
      For example, a challenge can be how to get the user's clothing size out of the pod and
      how to it use during shopping.
   3. For every challenge, create an issue in this repo with the [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/challenge.md) called "challenge".
