# SolidLab Challenges

This repository contains challenges that can be tackled during SolidLab.
Each challenge is represented by a separate issue.
Everybody is free to add new challenges using the provided template that you select when creating a new issue.
This template helps you with providing the needed information for a challenge.

The Working Group 1 (Use Cases) of the Outreach component of SolidLab will create different use cases.
You find the steps that you need to follow to turn these use cases into challenges via scenarios [here](use-case-flow.md).

Once a scenario or challenge is completed,
we write a report.
You find all reports [here](reports).
