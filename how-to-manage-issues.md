# How to manage issues

### New scenarios and challenges
Every new scenario and challenge gets the label "proposal: pending ❓" and
is assigned to Ruben Verborgh.
He checks if the scenario/challenge is explained well-enough and 
if all need information is present.
If everything is ok, the scenario/challenge gets the label "proposal: approved ✅", else
it gets the label "proposal: changes needed 👷" and changes are needed.

Once a challenge is approved Pieter Heyvaert looks for a lead for the challenge.

### Updates on ongoing challenges
Challenges that have a lead assigned require a status update via the issue every 2 weeks.

### Completed scenarios and challenges
Every scenario and challenge that is considered completed is assigned with the label "completion: pending ❓" and 
assigned to Ruben Verborgh.
He checks if all acceptance criteria are met and 
if the demo is sufficient. 
If everything is ok, the scenario/challenge gets the label "completion: approved ✅" and 
the issue is closed, else
it gets the label "completion: changes needed 👷" and changes are needed.
