# Public Community Solid Server instance for testing

The corresponding challenge is [#75](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/Challenges/issues/75).

## Problem

It would be great to have a public [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer)
(CSS) instance that can be used for testing. 
That way developers can quickly make an account to test or demo an application.

## Approved solution

We deployed a CSS instance at https://pod.playground.solidlab.be/.
Users can make accounts and 
have complete control over their data.
The instance is reset every 24 hours. 
During every reset the latest version of CSS is used.
It's possible to initiate the instance with a predefined set of accounts and corresponding data.

## Follow-up actions

None.

## Future work

None.
