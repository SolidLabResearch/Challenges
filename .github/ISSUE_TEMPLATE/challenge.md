<!--
Give the challenge a succinct, attractive title.

Example:
Greet the user with their preferred name
-->

## Pitch
<!--
Add in concrete terms what the problem is.

Example:
- Users like to be addressed by their preferred name within apps.
  - This is a name that they are known as, or use for themselves.
- In some cultures, this is the first name.
  - It could also be a user-chosen name or nickname.
- Other cultures do not have the concept of a first name, so another strategy is needed.
-->

## Desired solution
<!--
Add insights in how the solution should/can look like.

Example:
- Encode the rules for arriving at the preferred name in a declarative way.
  - For instance, using reasoning rules.
- Expose the functionality via JavaScript
  - For instance, through `getUserPreferredName` or `user.preferredName`
-->

## Acceptance criteria
<!--
Describe the criteria for a demo that needs to be built such that solution can be accepted.

Example:
- I want to see an example app with at the top right a user bar.
- This user bar shows a profile picture, and "Hi, Alex".
  - Here, "Alex" is the logged-in user's preferred name.
- This demo should work for people from different backgrounds.
  - people without a first name
  - people with a nickname
  - people with a chosen name
-->
