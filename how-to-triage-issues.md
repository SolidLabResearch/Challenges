# How to triage issues

Every new scenario and challenge gets the label "triage".
This means that one of the maintainers of the repo checks them
to determine:

1. Labels
2. Owner
3. Due date

## The labels
We use following labels.

- priority: what the priority is of the challenge.
- difficulty: how difficult it is to complete the challenge.
- duration: how long it will take to complete the challenge.

All of these labels can be low, medium, high.

## The owner
The best-suited owner is assigned to an issue based on the content of the scenario or challenge.

## Due date
The initial due date of an issue is set based on the content of the scenario or challenge, 
and the aforementioned labels.
