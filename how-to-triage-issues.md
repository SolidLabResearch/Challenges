# How to triage issues

Every new scenario and challenge gets the label "triage".
This means that one of the maintainers of the repo checks them
to determine:

- priority: what the priority is of the challenge.
- difficulty: how difficult it is to complete the challenge.
- duration: how long it will take to complete the challenge.

All of these labels can be low, medium, high.
